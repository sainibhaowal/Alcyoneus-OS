    This is a development/debugging publisher. It is opt-in: nothing wires it up
    unless you explicitly construct it and pass it to ``compile()``. **For
    production, use a real transport** (Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ, or OTEL) rather
    than this one.

    By default events are written to stdout via ``print`` so they are visible in
    a quick script without any logging setup. In a server context, where writing
    to stdout is undesirable, set ``use_logger=True`` to route events through the
    ``alcyoneus.publisher`` logger at ``INFO`` level instead, so they respect your
    logging configuration.
