"""Live voice weather assistant -- AudioAgent + Gemini Live, React-style tool calling.

Talk to it through your microphone and it talks back in real time. Ask "what's the
weather in Tokyo?" and the model calls the ``get_weather`` tool, then speaks the answer
it gets back -- the realtime analog of a ReactAgent's reason -> tool -> respond loop.

Features
    - Voice playback: the model's reply is played out loud on your speakers.
    - Tool calling: ``get_weather`` is advertised to the model and invoked on demand.
    - Echo-safe by default: the mic is muted while the agent is speaking, so it doesn't
      hear (and reply to) its own voice through your speakers.

Echo / feedback
    Without echo cancellation, your speaker audio leaks into the mic and the model
    transcribes its own replies as your input. This demo avoids that by muting the mic
    while the agent talks (half-duplex). Use headphones and set MIC_FULL_DUPLEX=1 for
    true full duplex with barge-in (speak over the agent to interrupt it).

Setup
    pip install "alcyoneus[realtime]" sounddevice
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=...                                # or Vertex AI env (see README)
    export GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL=...                             # optional, see README

Run
    python examples/realtime/audio_agent_mic.py
    # then say e.g. "What's the weather in Paris?" -- press Ctrl+C to stop.
